# Adding Context-Menu to the Bar Chart
As of API 2.2.0, you can use selectionManager.showContextMenu() with the parameters selectionId and a position to have Power BI disply the context menu for your visual.
Context-Menu was added to the sample BarChart for reference.
See [commit](https://github.com/Microsoft/PowerBI-visuals-sampleBarChart/commit/74b6a3c78ab40ec440e1d3367423ecdb9227ae6b) for what was added at this step.
More detailed documentation to follow.
